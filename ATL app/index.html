<h3 id="my-role">My role</h3>

<p>I was responsible for creating wireframes, talking to the client in order to iterate, and creating the visual design.</p>

<p>In addition, I worked alongside our Project Manager, Developer Team.</p>

<p>To keep everyone’s money safe, we make sure all customers are who they say they are. One way we do this is by asking them to take a photo of their passport or ID card. User used to get confused while uploading Documents.</p>

<h2 id="some-closing-words">Some closing words</h2>

<p>The project went on for the period of four months, with lots of back and forth and expert opinions from adjusters informing our design choices. My prototype was presented at a trade show shortly after, with positive reactions from the attendees, and we were told that an investment would be made into building out this inspection tool.</p>

<p>Due to the confidential nature of this project, we were not allowed to test the prototype with anyone outside of the project or dev team. </p>

<p>I would have liked to continue working on this project into the build stage, so that I could further improve the product with insights from adjusters using it in the field, verifying some of the assumptions with users beyond the ones we had on the team.</p>

<p>I’m grateful to have been given the opportunity to be the primary designer on this project , and equally grateful for all the support from an amazing team who backed me up. Hopefully we were able to move insurance closer into the 21st century, even if it’s just by a little bit.</p>
