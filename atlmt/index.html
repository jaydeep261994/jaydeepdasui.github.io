        <h2 id="my-role">My role</h2>

<p>Going through the valuable feedbacks from our customers, I found out more reasons as to why ATL Money transfer's usability can be significantly improved and rather it will also provide a seamless experience for your valuable  users.</p>

<h4 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h4>

<h2 id="educate-without-being-annoying">Educate without being annoying</h2>

<p>I was tasked with improving the What’s New experience in the M365 Admin Dashboard. What’s New is a link in the toolbar that directs users to an article outlining new features and updates, and we wanted to educate users in a better way.</p>

<h4 id="early-explorations">Early explorations</h4>
<h3 id="nice-workflow-let-me-disrupt-that">Project Time Line</h3>

<div class="image"><img class="shadow" src="../assets/images/projects/atlmt/designprocess.png" /><h5>Design Process</h5></div>

<h3 id="an-interesting-thought">Competitive Analysis</h3>

<p>ATL Money Transfer as a international Remittance service has many popular competitors that it has to face. for this reason, to begin my research, I looked at a few competitors to see where ATL stands relative to them. I analyzed their UI, UX, Information architecture, 
    User Flow and overall features.</p>

    <h3 id="an-interesting-thought">User's Needs</h3>

<p>I identified different scenarios users find themselves in when ever they want to make use of any remittance service, so as be able to understand their perspectives and desired outcome.</p>
<ul>
    <li>My brother just asked me for some money so he can be able to clear his dues in school, i need to send him money for that.</li>
    <li>I work in a different country and need to send money to my old parents back home.</li>
    <li>Needs to know the charges just by landing into the home page. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-things-on-a-dashboard">New looks</h2>
<h3 id="an-interesting-thought">Landing Page</h3>

<p>When new features are released for the admin dashboard, they’ll be highlighted and the user has the option to add or dismiss the card.</p>

<div class="image"><img class="shadow" src="../assets/images/projects/atlmt/webfront.png" /><h5>A new feature on the dashboard would be highlighted by a coloured card</h5></div>

<h3 id="new-things-in-the-panel">New things in the panel</h3>

<p>When new features are released in the side panel, they’re tagged “New” so that the user is aware.</p>

<div class="image"><img class="shadow" src="../assets/images/projects/atlmt/login.png" /><h5>New features in a panel would be labelled with a tag</h5></div>

<h3 id="new-things-on-a-page">New things on a page</h3>

<p>In pages other than the main dashboard, new features are highlighted in a big card so that users can learn about it.</p>

<div class="image"><img class="shadow" src="../assets/images/projects/atlmt/logininput.png" /><h5>New features on a page would be featured by a big banner</h5></div>

<h4 id="not-the-solution">Not the solution</h4>

<h2 id="one-time-use-only">One-time use only</h2>

<p>The problem with my explorations was that they only solved the What’s New problem for that particular screen. There was no consistency, and this was hard to work into a system. We took a step back after this to think about how What’s New can fit in everywhere.</p>

<h4 id="the-hypothesis">The hypothesis</h4>

<h2 id="contextually-showing-whats-new-is-better">Contextually showing what’s new is better</h2>

<h3 id="why-contextual">Why contextual?</h3>

<p>We believe that contextually showing what’s new is better, as we can show new additions without being disruptive.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can alert users without disrupting their workflow</li>
  <li>We can use each alert as a teaching opportunity</li>
  <li>This can become a system of alerting, recognizable by colour, motion, iconography, and copy.</li>
</ul>

<p>With our hypothesis in place, we went to tackle this problem starting from the top toolbar, designing while keeping in mind how we can apply what we make to other parts of M365.</p>

<h4 id="rapid-prototyping">Rapid prototyping</h4>

<h2 id="testing-our-hypothesis">Testing our hypothesis</h2>

<p>I used motion and colour to create two alerts for a new card, so that we could test this in front of existing M365 customers.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-sweep-to-draw-attention">Using a sweep to draw attention</h3>

<p>A large sweeping motion draws attention to the new feature, before shrinking out of view and leaving behind a persistent indicator (which will disappear upon interaction).</p>

<div class="image"><video class="shadow" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline=""><source src="../assets/images/projects/atlmt/atlwebsite.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video><h5>Send money page</h5></div>

<h3 id="using-a-call-out">Using a call-out</h3>

<p>A call-out describing the new feature appears first, and after a short delay, a dot badge follows. The delay is meant to allow users time to shift their attention over to the area of interest before the dot badge appears.</p>

<div class="image"><img class="shadow" src="../assets/images/projects/atlmt/dashboard.png" /><h5>New features on a page would be featured by a big banner</h5></div>
<h3 id="using-a-call-out">Responsive layout</h3>
<div class="image"><img class="shadow" src="../assets/images/projects/atlmt/responsive.png" /><h5>New features on a page would be featured by a big banner</h5></div>

<h3 id="using-a-call-out">Steps to send money</h3>
<div class="image"><video class="shadow" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline=""><source src="../assets/images/projects/atlmt/steps.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video><h5>Send money page</h5></div>

<h3 id="using-a-call-out">User Testing</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The website looks clean but needs more features like invite to earn.”</p>

  <p class="quotee">— Participant 1</p>
  <p>“Interactive and clean”</p>

  <p class="quotee">— Participant 2</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="image"><img src="../assets/images/projects/atlmt/details.png" /></div>

<p>We inferred from the user testing comments that just a badge is not enough, and that an attention grabber (like the sweep) to go along with it can help draw attention, and reinforce a system.</p>

<h4 id="refining-the-prototype">Refining the prototype</h4>

<h2 id="creating-a-system">Creating a system</h2>

<h3 id="a-new-colour-just-for-whats-new">A new colour, just for What’s New</h3>

<p>The previous prototypes used a teal colour, but that was an existing colour used for data visualization. I picked a new colour that would be solely used for this alerting system, and made sure it was WCAG AA compliant.</p>

<h3 id="consistent-motion-and-badging-everywhere">Consistent motion and badging everywhere</h3>

<p>M365 as a product lives on the web, and therefore, everything on M365 lives in a container. This would allow for a system to be applied everywhere, as long as the containers are similar in spacing and size.</p>

<p>With containers as a constraint, I limited the sweep to the element we want to draw attention to. A dot badge would follow and stay persistent, until the user interacts with it. A dot badge is something people are accustomed to seeing as “new”, so I leveraged that knowledge in my design.</p>

<h3 id="whats-new-on-the-top-toolbar">What’s New on the top toolbar</h3>

<p>Here’s what the alert looks like in action.</p>



<h3 id="whats-new-on-the-side-navigation">What’s New on the side navigation</h3>

<p>I created another motion study, showing the application of this system on the side navigation and on a different page. This was to show that this works elsewhere, and that the colour and badging can be used to create a recognizable contextual alerting system.</p>

<h4 id="some-considerations">Some considerations</h4>

<h2 id="details-we-thought-about">Details we thought about</h2>

<h3 id="what-happens-when-multiple-new-features-are-released">What happens when multiple new features are released?</h3>

<p>I put a bunch of dot badges on the dashboard, to show that it won’t overwhelm a user. As a precaution, we also set a time of 45 days before the dots disappear if the user doesn’t dismiss them. This time period was decided based on the longest time between logins, which was 6 weeks. Further tweaking, if needed, will be done based on future feedback.</p>

<h4 id="learnings-and-takeaways">Project Outcome </h4>



<p>We are currently in the process of analysing data and gathering additional feedback from ATL Money Transfer to get a full picture of how the new integration is performing.</p>

<h3 id="be-flexible-and-adaptable">What did I learn?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I merely wanted to try out my hands on a better solution that can Provide digital access to core remittance service. but at the course of my research, 
        I discovered more reasons why users deserve to have amazing experiences even while transacting. Also, I have learned more about the general digital 
        remittance industry.</li>
    <li>Secondly, it is difficult to change how people use the app, and rather than introduce an entire solution to a problem, sometimes it’s best to enhance 
        the existing structure and utilize UX patterns that users are familiar with.</li>

</ul>
