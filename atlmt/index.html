<h3 id="an-interesting-thought">Competitive Analysis</h3>

<p>ATL Money Transfer as a international Remittance service has many popular competitors that it has to face. for this reason, to begin my research, I looked at a few competitors to see where ATL stands relative to them. I analyzed their UI, UX, Information architecture, 
    User Flow and overall features.</p>

    <h3 id="an-interesting-thought">User's Needs</h3>

<p>I identified different scenarios users find themselves in when ever they want to make use of any remittance service, so as be able to understand their perspectives and desired outcome.</p>
<ul>
    <li>My brother just asked me for some money so he can be able to clear his dues in school, i need to send him money for that.</li>
    <li>I work in a different country and need to send money to my old parents back home.</li>
    <li>Needs to know the charges just by landing into the home page. </li>

<h4 id="learnings-and-takeaways">Project Outcome </h4>



<p>We are currently in the process of analysing data and gathering additional feedback from ATL Money Transfer to get a full picture of how the new integration is performing.</p>

<h3 id="be-flexible-and-adaptable">What did I learn?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I merely wanted to try out my hands on a better solution that can Provide digital access to core remittance service. but at the course of my research, 
        I discovered more reasons why users deserve to have amazing experiences even while transacting. Also, I have learned more about the general digital 
        remittance industry.</li>
    <li>Secondly, it is difficult to change how people use the app, and rather than introduce an entire solution to a problem, sometimes it’s best to enhance 
        the existing structure and utilize UX patterns that users are familiar with.</li>

</ul>
